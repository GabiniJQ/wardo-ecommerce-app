## 🎯 Key Technical Achievements

### 💳 **Secure Payment Processing**

* ✅ **Stripe Payment Integration** (Payment Element, Stripe.js)

  * Backend-only payment confirmation to prevent client-side tampering
  * PCI SAQ-A compliant implementation using Stripe-hosted elements
  * Custom Payment Element styling for brand consistency
  * Webhook infrastructure for `payment_intent.succeeded` and `payment_intent.failed` events
  * Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallback messaging

### 🔐 **Enterprise Authentication System**

* JWT-based auth with **access/refresh token pattern**

  * Access tokens stored in memory (Redux)
  * Refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies for XSS protection
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with `user` and `admin` roles
* Protected routes on both frontend and backend
* Automatic token refresh flow

### 🏗️ **Advanced State Management**

* **Redux Toolkit** with domain-driven slice architecture

  * `createAsyncThunk` for async operations (auth, products, cart sync)
  * Centralized error handling via global error state
  * Client-side caching strategy for improved performance

### ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**

* React lazy loading for code splitting (checkout route)
* MongoDB indexing on high-query fields (product name, category, user ID)
* Planned: API response caching layer

### 🐳 **Containerized Development Workflow**

* Dockerized local development environment using **Docker Compose**
* Multi-service orchestration (frontend, backend, database)
* Hot reload enabled via Docker Compose Watch
* Consistent tooling across environments without local dependency conflicts

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

* **React 19** + **TypeScript** (type-safe component architecture)
* **Redux Toolkit** (global state management with async thunks)
* **TailwindCSS** + **shadcn/ui** (modern, accessible component library)
* **React Router v7** (client-side routing with protected routes)
* **Zod** (runtime schema validation)
* **Stripe.js** + **Payment Element** (PCI-compliant payment UI)

### **Backend**

* **Node.js** + **Express.js** (RESTful API architecture)
* **MongoDB** + **Mongoose** (NoSQL data modeling)
* **JWT** (stateless authentication)
* **Stripe API** (payment processing)
* **Mailtrap** (email service integration)

### **DevOps & Tooling**

* **Docker & Docker Compose Watch** (containerized development environment)

### **Architecture Patterns**

* Custom error class (`AppError`) with centralized error middleware
* Database indexing strategy for query optimization
* Environment-based configuration management (dev, sandbox, production)

---

## 🚀 Features

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

You can run Wardo using either a traditional Node.js setup or an optional Dockerized development environment.

### Prerequisites (Non-Docker)

* Node.js 20+
* MongoDB instance
* Stripe account (test mode)

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabiniJQ/wardo-ecommerce-app.git
cd wardo-ecommerce-app
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

**Backend `.env`:**

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

**Frontend `.env`:**

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_LOCALHOST_KEY=google_captcha_key
```

### 3. Install & Run (Without Docker)

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🐳 Dockerized Development Environment (Optional)

Wardo includes an **optional Dockerized development environment** designed to simplify local setup and ensure consistency across machines.

This setup is intended **exclusively for development** and mirrors the local Node.js workflow using hot reload and bind mounts.
Production containerization is intentionally excluded at this stage.

### Services

* Frontend (React + Vite)
* Backend (Node.js + Express)
* MongoDB

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Access

* Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

> You can switch freely between Docker and non-Docker workflows depending on your preference.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (In development)

* **Unit Tests:** Jest for Redux reducers and utility functions
* **Integration Tests:** Auth flows and payment processing
* **E2E Tests:** Playwright/Cypress for complete checkout flow

---

## 🏆 Technical Challenges Solved

### **Secure Payment Flow Architecture**

Designed a backend-first payment confirmation system that:

* Prevents client-side payment tampering
* Synchronizes order state across database and Stripe
* Handles edge cases (duplicate charges, network failures)
* Maintains PCI compliance standards

### **JWT Refresh Token Implementation**

Built a seamless token refresh mechanism with:

* Automatic background token renewal
* Secure HTTP-only cookie storage
* Race condition handling for concurrent requests

### **Async State Consistency**

Managed complex async flows across multiple Redux slices while maintaining data integrity and preventing state desynchronization.
